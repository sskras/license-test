We are missing more than a few steps from EULA to [Blue Oak](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0).  As a result, companies unwilling to skip steps or take a giant leap get stuck more closed than they'd like to be, even if their faith in openness is very strong.  Managers at these clients often know the kind of open source success they want to emulate.  But they don't have good, standardized license support for each step along the way, in current business conditions.  Erratic spikes in standardization, name recognition, and free or open source bona fides cause many to stumble and fall.\n\nClients pay me to understand their needs and implement legal solutions.  They don't pay me to lobby them for my own philosophical point of view.  When my work for a client goes public---public software licenses usually are---I often take heat for writing a less-than-ideal license, from whatever point of view.\n\nThose critics are often surprised to learn that I'm very aware of their policy positions, and may even share their vision of license Utopia.  I was involved in [Blue Oak](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0.html), the most permissive rigorous license I know of, and also [Parity](https://paritylicense.com), the strongest copyleft.  But a shared vision is nothing without a practical program to realize it, starting where we are now.\n\nWe've seen companies take a licensing leap of faith, and plummet.  There's no wisdom in emulating their failures, for all the rights reasons.  Given the public-licensing ratchet, and where may engineering-driven startup managers want to go, of their own accord, good restricted and strong-copyleft licenses facilitate much more progress than regression.  We need more, not less of them, and should expect them to produce more wide-open permissive and copyleft software, in the long run, overall.",
